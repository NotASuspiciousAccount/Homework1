<p>While reading Chapter 1 of The Pragmatic Programmer, I noticed the book mainly focused on subjects that I only before heard about in brief conversations, such as how to communicate to others in your workplace or connect to others in the field. Out of all of these, however, the part that stood out to me most was how active I would need to be in the industry to ensure that I don't fall behind. Almost every tip outside of the workplace involved doing something, such as learning code, reading books, or staying in contact with those in the field. Of course, I noticed this part because I know it will be hard for me to stay active due to how much I procrastinate and play video games instead. To solve this, I will need to make a routine to make sure I don't just start learning different languages, but also keep learning languages. I will also need to look into books that I can read in the future (possibly over the summer), but I already know that Chapter 1 has some recommendations. For now, however, I don't know of any way to communicate with others in my field. I could try looking at the CS Club for solutions, though. All of that planning will only work if I overcome my procrastination, so I will make plans to start learning a language to ensure I don't just push it off until later an When I went into computer science, I expected to code things, but I never expected that there would be so much other activity in the field. Even outside of coding, I still have to be actively working towards a goal to stay ahead, which explains why I heard that computer science was a competitive field in the past.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning how the book said I needed to use certain methods to communicate, such as filtering out poor excuses or tricking people into giving yo what they want using subtle speech (such as "it would be better if it had this"). I see this as having two uses in the workplace: The first and obvious use is that I can more easily communicate with others to get what I want in a program. The second use, however, is to know when people are trying these tricks against me, so I can ask why or how the program would be better if it had what they wanted. Of course, it may still be better to play along in many cases, and just do what they want to improve the program. No matter what I use the information for, I know that knowing how to communicate will be useful when I work.</p>
