<p>When reading The Pragmatic Programmer, I noticed the book mainly focused on subjects that I only before heard about in brief conversations, such as how to communicate to others in your workplace or connect to others in the field.</p>
<p>Out of all of these, however, the part that stood out to me most was how active I would need to be in the industry to ensure that I don't fall behind.</p>
<p>Almost every tip outside of the workplace involved doing something, such as learning code, reading books, or staying in contact with those in the field.</p>
<p>Of course, I noticed this part because I know it will be hard for me to stay active due to how much I procrastinate and play video games instead.</p>
<p>To solve this, I will need to make a routine to make sure I don't just start learning different languages, but also keep learning languages.</p>
<p>I will also need to look into books that I can read in the future (possibly over the summer), but I already know that Chapter 1 has some recommendations.</p>
<p>For now, however, I don't know of any way to communicate with others in my field. I could try looking at the CS Club for solutions, though.</p>
<p>When I went into computer science, I expected to code things, but I never expected that there would be so much other activity in the field.</p>
<p>Even outside of coding, I still have to be actively working towards a goal to stay ahead, which explains why I heard that computer science was a competitive field in the past.</p>
